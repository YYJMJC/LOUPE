## Pre-Trained LOUPE Model
Unfortunately, our application to release the pre-trained model and code from the company intranet was not allowed. Now, we are re-implementing our model in the public-available platform using open-source pre-training dataset (LAION-400M), and we will provide the code and model in the future. We expect to release the first version in the first half of 2023. Also, we will further release a updated version (i.e., OpenLOUPE) with stronger open-world object-level grounding ability in the future.
